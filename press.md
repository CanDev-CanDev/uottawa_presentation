What is shiny?
========================================================

"shiny" <img src="images/shiny-hex.png" height="100px" width="100px" /> is a package used to create interactive dashboards without the necessity to know any HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

It was developed by Joe Cheng from RStudio.

Some of the benefits of using shiny are:

1. Interactivity.
2. Easy to share.
3. Relatively easy to develop (compared to other programing languages). 
4. Open source library. (RStudio, stackoverflow, github)
